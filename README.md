# Swiggy_Data_Analysis
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of Swiggy's order data to uncover key trends and insights. 
The analysis focused on customer behavior, popular cuisines, peak order times, and delivery efficiency. Using a combination of data cleaning, visualization, and statistical techniques, I explored patterns in the dataset, helping to identify factors driving customer satisfaction and operational performance. 


## Agenda of this project:

- Total Revenue by Restaurants.
- Top Five Dishes by Most Ordered.
- Time of Day Most Orders are Placed.
- Orders on Weekdays vs. Weekends.
- Count of Successful vs. Cancelled Orders and the Ratio.
- Delivery Partners with the Highest Delay Beyond Expected Delivery Time.
- City wise orders.
